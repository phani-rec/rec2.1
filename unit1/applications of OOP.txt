OOPs is the most important and flexible paradigm of modern programming. 
It is specifically useful in modeling real-world problems. 

Below are some applications of OOPs:
------------------------------------

  Real-Time System design:
  .......................
	Real-time system inherits complexities and 
	makes it difficult to build them. OOP techniques make it easier to 
	handle those complexities.
    
  Hypertext and Hypermedia: 
  ..........................
	Hypertext is similar to regular text as 
	it can be stored, searched, and edited easily. Hypermedia on the 
	other hand is a superset of hypertext. OOP also helps in laying 
	the framework for hypertext and hypermedia.
    
  AI Expert System:
  .................
	These are computer application that is developed
	to solve complex problems which are far beyond the human brain.
	OOP helps to develop such an AI expert System
    
  Office automation System: 
  .........................
	These include formal as well as informal 
	electronic systems that primarily concerned with information sharing
	and communication to and from people inside and outside the organization.
	OOP also help in making office automation principle.
    
  Neural networking and parallel programming: 
  ...........................................
	It addresses the problem of prediction and approximation of 
	complex-time varying systems. OOP simplifies the entire process 
	by simplifying the approximation and prediction ability of the network.
    
	Stimulation and modeling system:
	It is difficult to model complex 
	systems due to varying specifications of variables. 
	Stimulating complex systems require modeling and understanding
	interaction explicitly. OOP provides an appropriate approach 
	for simplifying these complex models.
    
  Object-oriented database: 
  .............................
	The databases try to maintain a direct 
	correspondence between the real world and database object in order
	to let the object retain it identity and integrity.
    
  Client-server system: 
  .....................
	Object-oriented client-server system provides
	the IT infrastructure creating object-oriented server internet(OCSI) applications.
    
  CIM/CAD/CAM systems: 
  ......................
	OOP can also be used in manufacturing and 
	designing applications as it allows people to reduce the efforts involved. 
	For instance, it can be used while designing blueprints and flowcharts.
	So it makes it possible to produce these flowcharts and blueprint accurately.
