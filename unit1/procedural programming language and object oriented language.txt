procedural programming language and object oriented language

What is Procedural Programming?
--------------------------------
You can define Procedural Programming as a programming model 
derived from structural programming. It follows the concept 
of the calling procedure. The procedures, also called functions, 
routines, or subroutines, consist of a series of computational 
steps that they need to carry out. During the execution of a 
program, one can call any given procedure at any point- either 
by other procedures or by itself.

Procedural Programming Languages – 
BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL, Pascal, and C.

What is Object Oriented Programming?
------------------------------------
You can define Object Oriented Programming as a programming model
 that follows the concept of objects. The objects contain codes in the
 form of methods and data in the form of attributes. In the case of 
 Object Oriented Programming, it designs computer programs by using the
 concept of the objects interacting with the real world. There are 
 various Object Oriented Programming languages. But the most popular 
 ones among all are class-based. It means that the objects are instances
 of the classes determining their types.

Object Oriented Programming Languages – 
Java, Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Dart, Perl, Swift, Scala, Objective.
