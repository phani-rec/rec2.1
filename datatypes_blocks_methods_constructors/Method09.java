/*
What is a method in Java?

A method is a block of code or collection of statements 
or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation.
It is used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once 
and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. 
It also provides the easy modification and readability of code, 
just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed 
only when we call or invoke it.
